As discussed in the [overview of the GAS distribution mechanism](https://github.com/lacchain/gas-management/blob/master/overview/OVERVIEW.MD), the transaction-fee based mechanisms adopted by the most popular permissionless blockchain networks, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, make them very unaffordable for use cases involving large amounts of transactions, such as typical government and enterprise solutions. In this appendix, we compare the difference in price between the transaction-fee based permissionless Ethereum Mainnet and the membership-fee based permissioned LACNet Network.

[TABLE 1]

* (*) This calculation is the result of multiplying the maximum GAS per block for each membership in LACNet by the average block number per month, considering block generation every 2 seconds.

* (**) This calculation is the result of multiplying the maximum amount of GAS per month for each membership in LACNet by the price of the unit of GAS in Ethereum, using that 1 unit of gas are 60gWei=6E-08Ether and 1Ether=$2,000.

The maximum amount of GAS that the basic membership of LACNet offers per month on its Network for 170 dollars would cost an equivalent of more than 77 million dollars on Ethereum Mainnet. The intermediate, offers a maximum amount of GAS for 380 dollars that in Ethereum would cost more than 233 million dollars, and with the premium goes from 1250 dollars to more than 777 million dollars. Unlike Ethereum Mainnet, LACChain is a network designed for highly transactional projects.
